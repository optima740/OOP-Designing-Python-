# OOP-Designing-Python-

This repository contains my implementations of the main concepts of object-oriented programming that I have mastered for training purposes. 

The repository root contains my implementations of Python data structures that I designed using the concept of an abstract data type (ADT):

- abstract data type concept applied to Python;
- dynamic array (ADT);
- linked list (ADT);
- two-line queue (ADT);
- hash table (ADT);
- associative array (ADT);
- set (ADT).

Level_2 contains my theoretical arguments and code examples on inheritance, types of inheritance, is-a, has-a relationships.
